  <p>So your new to minecraft or not well it doesn't matter!</p>
  <p>Any one can read this so lets get started on our guide!</p>
  <p>So first make a world and make survival or creative. But if your new i would recommend creative to learn about minecraft but if your're old enough try survival! So when you created your world get wood and build tools. When you have enough wood you can make a house so you can survive the zombies. But if you have a sword you can go outside and fight those zombies and get xp. once it becomes day you can mine some stone and and craft stone tools and also get more wood and coal to craft some torches so its not dark and keep finding ores like iron,gold,diamonds and netherite and get eyes of ender and craft some eyes for the end portal. Once you found your portal place those eyes enter and you have climb those obsidian pillars and destroy those crystal but dont get too close because if you destroy the crystal when you are way too close you get finished immediately. When you destroy the crystals attack the dragon until his health goes down. Beware of the endermen and the dragon attacks and i suggesting placing beds when the dragon is near the ground because the beds explode in the nether and in the end and it takesalot of damages and when you beat the dragon enter the portal and you will get a outro.</p>
